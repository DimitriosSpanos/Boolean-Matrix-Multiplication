# Parallel-Exercise4

The three version of the BMM(and filtered_BMM) are
the serial implementation, the openmp parallelized implementation
and the parallelized with both openmp and MPI.

The libraries openMP and MPI are required to run these 3
versions locally. This can be done by using the following commands:

```
1. make clean
2. make all
3. make test
```
